# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the **Iris Dataset** using Python's `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries. The analysis includes loading the dataset, performing basic data exploration, statistical analysis, and creating visualizations to understand the relationships between different features.

The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers, across three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. The dataset includes the following features:
- **sepal length** (in cm)
- **sepal width** (in cm)
- **petal length** (in cm)
- **petal width** (in cm)
- **variety** (the species of the iris)

## Objectives

- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- **Basic Data Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis and group by the species.
- **Data Visualization**: Create various plots including bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:

- `pandas`: for data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib`: for plotting charts
- `seaborn`: for enhanced data visualizations
- `numpy`: for numerical operations (optional)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
